Delete Dictionary Elements
You can either remove individual dictionary elements or clear the entire contents of a dictionary. You can also delete entire dictionary in a single operation.

To explicitly remove an entire dictionary, just use the del statement. Following is a simple example −


"""


dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}

del dict['Name'] # remove entry with key 'Name'
dict.clear()     # remove all entries in dict
del dict         # delete entire dictionary

print ("dict['Age']: ", dict['Age'])
print ("dict['School']: ", dict['School'])


"""
This produces the following result.

An exception is raised because after del dict, the dictionary does not exist anymore.

dict['Age']:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 8, in <module>
      print "dict['Age']: ", dict['Age'];
TypeError: 'type' object is unsubscriptable
Note − The del() method is discussed in subsequent section.
